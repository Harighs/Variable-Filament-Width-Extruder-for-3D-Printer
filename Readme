Hello Guys Thanks for visiting me again
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
DESCRIPTION:
This project has to goal of printing every material regardless of what the melting temperature 
also we can equip the printer with filament sensor. I had outsourced the sensor so this project
will be only focusing on printer, firmware, and electronics of printers only.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Feautures:
--> Printing is possible from 40 degree celcius to 450 degree celcius

--> Usage of real time filament measuring sensor (can automatically vary the extrusion speed)

--> We can able to print not only Polymers(Plastics like PLA, ABS) but also Metals (Steel,
    Copper, and also ceramics)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This version_1
can print 40 to 375 degree celcius with normal usual 10k thermistor.
for printing upto 450 (differnt thermister is needed) furthur update will be posted.
Details of the sensor will be disclosed very soon within 1 week (17th May 2020)
