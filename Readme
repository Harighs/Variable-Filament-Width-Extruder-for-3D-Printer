Hello Guys Thanks for visiting me again
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
DESCRIPTION:
This project has the goal of printing every material regardless of varied diameter along with the printing.
"PERFECTLY USEFUL IF you're MAKING YOUR OWN FILAMENT OR RECYCLING YOUR OLD MATERIALS AND MAKING FILAMENT OUT OF IT"
we can equip the printer with a filament sensor. Each and every details will be updated for each version of printers and different motherboards.
I had outsourced the sensor so this project
will be only focusing on the printer, firmware, and electronics of printers.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Future Supportis always available for this project, I will try to help you out if you contact me
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Feautures:
--> Has the goal of the extruding materials with a filament sensor

--> All details of Electronics, Hardware, Software and Procedures are elaborated and futuring full support if needed for you

--> We are able to use normal usual thermistor which your're using now with your printer 

Thank you...
--> Printing is possible from 40 degree celcius to 450 degree celcius

--> Usage of real time filament measuring sensor (can automatically vary the extrusion speed)

--> We can able to print not only Polymers(Plastics like PLA, ABS) but also Metals (Steel,
    Copper, and also ceramics)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This version_1
can print 40 to 375 degree celcius with normal usual 10k thermistor.
for printing upto 450 (differnt thermister is needed) furthur update will be posted.
Details of the sensor will be disclosed very soon within 1 week (17th May 2020)
